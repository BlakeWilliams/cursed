A collection of small focused tools attempting to create a larger node
ecosystem.

## Packages

* [🔮✅Spec](./spec) - The testing package. Used to test itself and other packages
  in the ecosystem.
* [🔮🎸Metal](./metal) - The low-level web middleware layer. Used to abstract
* [🔮💻CLI](./cli) - `npm run` replacement with user and package definable
    commands. tl;dr one CLI to rule them all.
